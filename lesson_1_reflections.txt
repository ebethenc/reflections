Q: How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
A: You could comeback to different versions and remove bugs on newer versions

3)
Q: What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
A: more control on the abstraction that each commit represents

4) 
Q: Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

5)

A: using commit ids

6)
Q: How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
